Your <%= link_to "Charcut.io" , root_url %> meat box <%= @box.name %> is in trouble!

According to our sensors, the <%= @data_type %> in your box has averaged <%= @average_value %><%= "%" if data_type == :humidity %> over the past hour, when it should have been closer to <%= desired_value %>. That's a problem! Looks like something has gone wrong on-site, and you need to look into it stat!

Your box is located at: <%= @box.address %>

Hurry up and go check on your meat!
