Your <%= link_to "Charcut.io" , root_url %> meat box <%= @box.name %> is in trouble!

We haven't received any <%= @dead_data_point.data_type %> data from your box since <%= @dead_data_point.created_at %>. Under normal conditions, we receive data from each box nearly every second. Something has gone horribly wrong on-site, and you need to look into it stat!

Your box is located at: <%= @box.address %>

Hurry up and go check on your meat!
