    <h1>Your <%= link_to "Charcut.io" , root_url %> meat box <%= @box.name %> is in trouble!</h1>
    <p>
      We haven't received any <%= @dead_data_point.data_type %> data from your box since <%= @dead_data_point.created_at %>. Under normal conditions, we receive data from each box nearly every second. Something has gone horribly wrong on-site, and you need to look into it stat!
    </p>
    <p>Your box is located at: <%= @box.address %></p>
    <p>Hurry up and go check on your meat!</p>
